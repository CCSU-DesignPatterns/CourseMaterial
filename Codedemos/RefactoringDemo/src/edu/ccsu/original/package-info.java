/**
 * This package contains the original version of 5 classes that are to be refactored
 * that provide examples of refactoring by inheritance, refactoring by delegation, and 
 * the emergence of the Template pattern.  Good modular practices would not have all 
 * of these classes in the same package, it is just this way to make it easier to see
 * the before and after version.
