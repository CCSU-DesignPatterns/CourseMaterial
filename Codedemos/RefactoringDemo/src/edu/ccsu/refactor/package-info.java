/**
 * This package contains the refactored version of the classes in the edu.ccsu.original package
 * that were to be refactored. They provide examples of refactoring by inheritance, refactoring 
 * by delegation, and the emergence of the Template pattern.  Good modular practices would not have all 
 * of these classes in the same package, it is just this way to make it easier to see
 * the before and after version.
